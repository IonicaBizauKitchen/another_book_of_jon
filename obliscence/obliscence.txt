Obliscence

The way I reflect on my father reminds of why I don't like to lock doors; I know that it is in people to lie, steal, and generally disregard the well-being of their fellow man, but I tend to make a point of ignoring that human tendency. When thinking back on what my life was like as a kid, and how I felt about my father, my memory seems to color it forgivingly, either out of wisdom or personal protection.

I generally don't lock my doors - to my house, my car, anything. As many times as I've been robbed, I never feel like locking the door is a reasonable response: it only perpetuates the feeling of isolation, of distrust for one's fellow man. I generally make an effort to forgive the human tendency to lie, cheat, and steal, rather than affirm it.

The overwhelming majority of stories and memories in this book are positive; they comprise many of my fondest childhood memories.. but why didn't the bad make its way up along with the good? Was some part of me reluctant to pull my darker memories to the surface, or has my mind, over time, learned things from that darkness and forged it into something positive and valuable? Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in the middle.


it seems that my overall emotional response/relationship to my father is positive. I find this concerning and intriguing, as I spent a good portion of my time as a child resenting my father and what I thought to be his many shortcomings as a person. I suppose this says something about me.
