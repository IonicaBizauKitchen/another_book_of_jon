The Spoon Shortage

There was always a shortage of spoons in the house. We had more forks and knives than we knew what to do with; they filled up the silverware drawer beyond capacity. At one point we had so many forks that the ambiguous fourth silverware slot was used to hold the overflow. But the spoons numbered so few. It seemed we only ever had three or four at most. As dishwasher of the house, I was reminded nightly of this strange phenomenon, and for many years it remained a source of confusion to me.

It wasn't until long after having come to know that my father was a heroin user that I finally made the connection. 

What had he done with all those spoons after soiling them beyond repair, after melting that black crust onto their surfaces?  What did his 'rig' look like? Did he have a bag; a leather pouch; a little box? How was it that through all the years of my childhood I never once stumbled upon it, under the seat of his truck, or inside the piano? What had he thought to himself when I so often questioned the family about the possible causes of the mysterious spoon shortage? Had my mother quietly, and without great resolve, made a point of replacing the spoon supply?

These days I relish the plenitude of spoons available in my kitchen. I use them with reckless abandon, as if to make up for a deprived childhood. Gone are the days of having to track down a dirty spoon and wash it before eating my cereal.


Spoonful

Men lies about a-little,
Some of 'em cries about a-little,
Some of 'em dies about a-little,
Everything a fight about a spoonful.

That spoon- That spoon- That spoonful.
